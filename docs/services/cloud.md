CyVerse has a long history working with [:simple-openstack: OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) based clouds, including its deprecated "[Atmosphere](https://user.cyverse.org/services/1){target=_blank}" and "Jetstream" User Interfaces.

CyVerse has built continuous frameworks for its own [![][atmo]{width=25}](https://atmo.cyverse.org){target=_blank} [Atmosphere](https://atmo.cyverse.org){target=_blank} cloud and for [Jetstream 2](https://jetstream-cloud.org){target=_blank}

[![][cacao]{width=30}](https://gitlab.com/cyverse/cacao/-/blob/master/README.md){target=_blank} [CACAO](https://gitlab.com/cyverse/cacao/-/blob/master/README.md){target=_blank} is a project enabling Continuous Analysis on Kubernetes clusters.

CyVerse is partnered with [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/){target=_blank} to manage cloud-native applications such as Terraform, Argo Workflows, and Kubernetes.  

Access to [Jetstream2 login](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application){target=_blank} is managed through [ACCESS-CI](https://access-ci.org/){target=_blank}.

CyVerse CACAO documentation can also be found on [Jetstream2](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/) Project docs.
